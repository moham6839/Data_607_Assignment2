```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Loading Necessary Libraries

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(RMySQL)
library(dbplyr)
library(DBI)
library(keyring)
```

## Converting SQL table to R DataFrame

I imported a table called Movie Ratings Survey through the MySQL database Movie Rating. In order to hide the password, I used the Keyring library in order to gain access into the MySQL Database. The dataset consists of ratings from family and friends of movies that were recently released. The rating scale is from 1 to 5, 1 representing the person extremely dislikes the movie and would not recommend the movie, and 5 being extremely likes the movie and would recommend the movie.

```{r}

#psswd <- .rs.askForPassword("Database Password:")
sql_db_con <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user='root', password=key_get('MySQL', 'root'),
                        dbname="Movie_Rating", host='localhost')


dbListTables(sql_db_con)
movie_ratings <- tbl(sql_db_con, 'Movie_Ratings_Survey')
movie_ratings


dbListFields(sql_db_con, 'Movie_Ratings_Survey')
rs = dbSendQuery(sql_db_con, "select * from Movie_Ratings_Survey")
data <- fetch(rs, n=-1)
data
```
## Snapshot of Data

Now that my data is loaded, I explored the dataset further:

```{r}
glimpse(data)
dim(data)
mean(data$Rating)
median(data$Rating)
colSums(data==0)
```



## Finding Average and Median Ratings by Name and Film

There are 5 values in the dataset that have a 0 rating, which indicates that the respondents may not have watched the movie and therefore did not give a rating for the movie. To fill in those values, I subsetted the data looking at the mean and median based on Name and Film, respectively. From the results, I will choose how to fill in the zero values.

### Average Rating by Name

```{r}
new_data <- data %>%
  group_by(Name) %>%
  summarise(new_rating = mean(Rating))
new_data
```

### Average Rating by Film

```{r}
new_film_data <- data %>%
  group_by(Film) %>%
  summarise(new_rating = mean(Rating))
new_film_data
```

### Median Rating by Name

```{r}
new_data_median <- data %>%
  group_by(Name) %>%
  summarise(new_rating = median(Rating))
new_data_median
```
### Median Rating by Film

```{r}
new_film_median <- data %>%
  group_by(Film) %>%
  summarise(new_rating = median(Rating))
new_film_median
```
## Replacing Zero Values with NA

I transformed the zero values into NA values in order to replace the values with either the mean or median based on Name or Film.

```{r}
data[data == 0] <- NA                           
data 
```

## Handling Missing Data

For the values that have a zero, I will use the median value of the respondents' response to the other movies they gave ratings for.

```{r}
final_dataset <- data %>% 
        group_by(Name) %>% 
        mutate_at("Rating", function(x) replace(x, is.na(x), median(x, na.rm = TRUE)))
final_dataset
```

Checking to see if there's any NA values in final_dataset created:

```{r}
sum(is.na(final_dataset))
```


## Summarizing Final Dataset


```{r}
new_final_dataset <- final_dataset %>%
  group_by(Film) %>%
  summarise(new_final_rating = mean(Rating))
new_final_dataset
```

## Plotting new_final_dataset

I created a barplot using the new_final_dataset:


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(new_final_dataset, aes(x=reorder(Film,-new_final_rating), y=new_final_rating)) + 
    geom_bar(color='black', fill='blue', position="dodge", stat="identity") +
  xlab("Film") + ylab("Movie Rating") + ggtitle("Movie Ratings by Film")
```

As the barplot shows, Avatar rated the highest among the respondents, while Elvis rated the lowest.
